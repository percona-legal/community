MariaDB Fest 2020[/caption]
Our Fest is the opportunity to have live interactions with the key players on MariaDB Server: the developers of MariaDB Server, the service providers, the experts, the system integrators, and – perhaps most importantly – your fellow users!
Interactivity happens all the time, with the presenters being cloned and available for answering questions throughout the presentation.</description></item><item><title>MariaDB Server Fest: Call for Papers</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2020-06-26-mariadb-server-fest-call-for-papers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jun 2020 21:42:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2020-06-26-mariadb-server-fest-call-for-papers/</guid><description>In the week of 14-20 September 2020, MariaDB Foundation will host the MariaDB Server Fest Online Conference.

Abstract There are many good databases out there. Picking the right database for your project is never easy. There are technical criteria, business criteria, perhaps even ethical criteria. In this keynote, MariaDB Foundation CEO Kaj Arno will present his - obviously completely impartial - view of the process. Should you pick a database in the cloud or on premise?</description></item></channel></rss>
