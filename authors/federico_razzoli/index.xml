Communities are the real strength of open source. Not just the theoretical ability to study, modify and share code – but the fact that other people out there are doing these things. Creating a base of knowledge and a network of relations.These can become work relationships, valuable discussions, open source tools, or even friendships.
That is why, when I heard that several people from the Percona support team will soon be in London, I badly wanted to organise an event.</description></item><item><title>Some Notes on MariaDB system-versioned Tables</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2018-12-14-notes-mariadb-system-versioned-tables/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Dec 2018 14:53:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2018-12-14-notes-mariadb-system-versioned-tables/</guid><description>As mentioned in a previous post, I gave a talk at Percona Live Europe 2018 about system-versioned tables. This is a new MariaDB 10.3 feature, which consists of preserving old versions of a table rows. Each version has two timestamps that indicate the start (INSERT,UPDATE) of the validity of that version, and its end (DELETE, UPDATE). As a result, the user is able to query these tables as they appear at a point in the past, or how data evolved in a certain time range.</description></item><item><title>Percona Live Europe Presents: MariaDB System-Versioned Tables</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2018-10-17-percona-live-europe-presents-mariadb-system-versioned-tables/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Oct 2018 16:14:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2018-10-17-percona-live-europe-presents-mariadb-system-versioned-tables/</guid><description>System-versioned tables, or temporal tables, are a typical feature of proprietary database management systems like DB2, Oracle and SQL Server. They also appeared at some point in PostgreSQL, but only as an extension; and also in CockroachDB, but in a somewhat limited fashion.
The MariaDB® implementation is the first appearance of temporal tables in the MySQL ecosystem, and the most complete implementation in the open source world.</description></item></channel></rss>
