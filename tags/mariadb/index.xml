Abstract In most machine learning tasks, one has to first organize data in some form and then turn it into information about the problem that needs to be solved. One could say that the requirement to train many machine learning algorithms is information, not just data.</description></item><item><title>Analytical Queries in MySQL – Percona Live ONLINE Talk Preview</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2020-10-09-analytical-queries-in-mysql-percona-live-online-talk-preview/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Oct 2020 17:05:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2020-10-09-analytical-queries-in-mysql-percona-live-online-talk-preview/</guid><description>Percona Live Online Agenda Slot: Tue 20 Oct • New York 6:00 p.m. • London 11:00 p.m. • New Delhi 3:30 a.m. • Singapore 6:00 a.m.
Abstract MySQL&amp;rsquo;s sweet spot is known to be online transaction processing (OLTP), and it can support a very high load of short transactions. Many users will also want to run analytical queries (OLAP) on their MySQL data. Often they achieve this by exporting their data to another database system that is tailored for analytical queries.</description></item><item><title>MySQL Ecosystem on ARM – Percona Live ONLINE Talk Preview</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2020-10-08-mysql-ecosystem-on-arm-percona-live-online-talk-preview/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Oct 2020 02:28:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2020-10-08-mysql-ecosystem-on-arm-percona-live-online-talk-preview/</guid><description>Percona Live Online Agenda Slot: Tue 20 Oct • New York 8:00 p.m. • London 1:00 a.m (next day) • New Delhi 5:30 a.m. • Singapore 8:00 a.m.
Abstract? The ARM ecosystem is quickly evolving as a cost-effective alternative to run High-Performance Computing (HPC) software. It continues to grow with some major cloud players hosting ARM-based cloud servers. MySQL too joined the ecosystem with 8.x. MariaDB already has made its presence.</description></item><item><title>MariaDB 10.5 New Features for Troubleshooting – Percona Live ONLINE Talk Preview</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2020-10-01-mariadb-10-5-new-features-for-troubleshooting-percona-live-online-talk-preview/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2020 23:42:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2020-10-01-mariadb-10-5-new-features-for-troubleshooting-percona-live-online-talk-preview/</guid><description>Percona Live Online Agenda Slot: Wed 21 Aug • New York 12:00 midnight • London 05:00 a.m. • New Delhi 9:30 a.m. • Singapore 12:00 noon

This is something that Peter Zaitsev, co-founder and CEO of Percona, understands very well.
In the build-up to his hands-on presentation with the open source Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) platform, Peter spoke about how inducting a database in an organization is a constant tussle between the developers, the management and the DBAs.</description></item><item><title>Percona Live ONLINE Opening Keynote: State of Open Source Databases by Peter Zaitsev</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2020-06-15-percona-live-online-opening-keynote-state-of-open-source-databases-by-peter-zaitsev/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jun 2020 15:44:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2020-06-15-percona-live-online-opening-keynote-state-of-open-source-databases-by-peter-zaitsev/</guid><description>Peter Zaitsev is CEO and co-founder of Percona. He opened Percona Live ONLINE with a keynote which took a look at the historical foundations of open source software and how they have shaped the field today.
The history of open source software In the early days of computing, software and hardware were bundled together. While the term open source wasn&amp;rsquo;t coined, software was open by default. According to Peter: &amp;ldquo;One of the big reasons for that was copyrights on software was not a thing, because the software was not really a thing before that.</description></item><item><title>MariaDB 10.4 and the Competition – Percona Live ONLINE Talk Preview</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2020-05-07-mariadb-10-4-and-the-competition-percona-live-online-talk-preview/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 May 2020 23:10:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2020-05-07-mariadb-10-4-and-the-competition-percona-live-online-talk-preview/</guid><description>Percona Live Online Agenda Slot: Tue 19 May • New York 12:30 p.m. • London 5:30 p.m. • New Delhi 10:00 p.m.
Abstract There are many good databases out there. Picking the right database for your project is never easy. There are technical criteria, business criteria, perhaps even ethical criteria. In this keynote, MariaDB Foundation CEO Kaj Arno will present his - obviously completely impartial - view of the process.

Abstract MariaDB Server 10.4 has been out for some time now (June 2019) and it has many new features, some of which MySQL does not have. Feature-wise, it is important to know what MariaDB Server 10.4 has (e.g. system tables in the Aria storage engine, ability to reload SSL certificates without a restart and more!</description></item><item><title>Finding MySQL Scaling Problems Using perf</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2020-02-05-finding-mysql-scaling-problems-using-perf/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Feb 2020 16:18:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2020-02-05-finding-mysql-scaling-problems-using-perf/</guid><description>The thing I wish I&amp;rsquo;d learned while still a DBA is how to use perf. Conversely after moving to a developer role, getting access to real external client workloads to get a perf recording directly is rare. To bridge this gap, I hope to encourage a bit of perf usage to help DBAs report bugs/feature requests in more detail to MySQL developers, who can then serve your needs better.
A recent client request showed how useful perf is in exposing the areas of MySQL that are otherwise well tuned, but can still be in need of coding improvements that increase throughput.</description></item><item><title>Minimalist Tooling for MySQL/MariaDB DBAs</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2019-08-14-minimalist-tooling-for-mysql-mariadb-dbas/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2019 14:21:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2019-08-14-minimalist-tooling-for-mysql-mariadb-dbas/</guid><description>In my roles as a DBA at various companies, I generally found the tooling to be quite lacking. Everything from metrics collection, alerting, backup management; they were either missing, incomplete or implemented poorly. DBA-Tools was born from a desire to build backup tools that supported my needs in smaller/non-cloud environments. As BASH is easily the most common shell available out there on systems running MySQL® or MariaDB®, it was an easy choice.</description></item><item><title>MySQL 5.6/Maria 10.1 : How we got from 30k qps to 101k qps.....</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2019-08-07-mysql-how-we-got-from-30k-qps-to-101k-qps/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Aug 2019 07:52:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2019-08-07-mysql-how-we-got-from-30k-qps-to-101k-qps/</guid><description>Late one evening, I was staring at one of our large MySQL installations and noticed the database was hovering around 7-10 run queue length (48 cores, ~500 gigs memory, fusionIO cards). I had been scratching my head on how to get more throughput from the database. This blog records the changes I made to tune performance in order to achieve a 300% better throughput in MySQL.

Communities are the real strength of open source. Not just the theoretical ability to study, modify and share code – but the fact that other people out there are doing these things. Creating a base of knowledge and a network of relations.These can become work relationships, valuable discussions, open source tools, or even friendships.
That is why, when I heard that several people from the Percona support team will soon be in London, I badly wanted to organise an event.</description></item><item><title>Some Notes on MariaDB system-versioned Tables</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2018-12-14-notes-mariadb-system-versioned-tables/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Dec 2018 14:53:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2018-12-14-notes-mariadb-system-versioned-tables/</guid><description>As mentioned in a previous post, I gave a talk at Percona Live Europe 2018 about system-versioned tables. This is a new MariaDB 10.3 feature, which consists of preserving old versions of a table rows. Each version has two timestamps that indicate the start (INSERT,UPDATE) of the validity of that version, and its end (DELETE, UPDATE). As a result, the user is able to query these tables as they appear at a point in the past, or how data evolved in a certain time range.</description></item><item><title>Percona Live Europe Presents: MariaDB 10.4 Reverse Privileges (DENY)</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2018-10-23-mariadb-10-4-reverse-privileges-deny/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Oct 2018 11:41:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2018-10-23-mariadb-10-4-reverse-privileges-deny/</guid><description>One of the most common questions about privileges in MySQL and MariaDB is how would a user revoke access to a particular table, in a large database with hundreds or thousands of tables, while keeping the rest available. Currently, there is no easy solution. Just grant access to everything else, individually. Not only does this reduce server performance, but is a nightmare to maintain. Reverse privileges solve this and more.</description></item><item><title>Percona Live Europe Presents: MariaDB System-Versioned Tables</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2018-10-17-percona-live-europe-presents-mariadb-system-versioned-tables/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Oct 2018 16:14:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2018-10-17-percona-live-europe-presents-mariadb-system-versioned-tables/</guid><description>System-versioned tables, or temporal tables, are a typical feature of proprietary database management systems like DB2, Oracle and SQL Server. They also appeared at some point in PostgreSQL, but only as an extension; and also in CockroachDB, but in a somewhat limited fashion.
The MariaDB® implementation is the first appearance of temporal tables in the MySQL ecosystem, and the most complete implementation in the open source world.</description></item><item><title>Percona Live Europe Session: What's New in MariaDB Server 10.3</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2018-10-16-percona-live-europe-session-whats-new-mariadb-server-10-3/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Oct 2018 12:42:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2018-10-16-percona-live-europe-session-whats-new-mariadb-server-10-3/</guid><description>** Having spent my recent years &amp;ldquo;in the real world&amp;rdquo;, working with many users, I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt that a particular new feature does not necessarily excite users as much as one might expect. MariaDB 10.3 however actually has some very interesting features that users do get excited about.
So that&amp;rsquo;s great!
My session at Percona Live Europe in Frankfurt is going to be best for people deploying MariaDB or related infra, who haven&amp;rsquo;t had a chance to explore what the various features actually mean, or what they can do with them.</description></item><item><title>Percona Live Europe Tutorial: Query Optimization and TLS at Large Scale</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2018-10-15-percona-live-europe-tutorial-query-optimization-workshop-tls-large-scale-session/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Oct 2018 14:05:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2018-10-15-percona-live-europe-tutorial-query-optimization-workshop-tls-large-scale-session/</guid><description>For Percona Live Europe this year, I got accepted a workshop on query optimization and a 50-minute talk covering TLS for MySQL at Large Scale, talking about our experiences at the Wikimedia Foundation.

In this post, Alexey Mikotkin of Devart explores your choices for generating identifiers with a look at auto_increment, triggers, UUID and sequences.
AUTO_INCREMENT Frequently, we happen to need to fill tables with unique identifiers. Naturally, the first example of such identifiers is PRIMARY KEY data. These are usually integer values hidden from the user since their specific values are unimportant.</description></item><item><title>Percona Live Europe Tutorial: Elasticsearch 101</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2018-10-03-percona-live-tutorial-elasticsearch-101/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Oct 2018 07:17:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2018-10-03-percona-live-tutorial-elasticsearch-101/</guid><description>For Percona Live Europe, I&amp;rsquo;ll be presenting the tutorial Elasticsearch 101 alongside my colleagues and fellow presenters from ObjectRocket Alex Cercel, DBA, and Mihai Aldoiu, Data Engineer. Here&amp;rsquo;s a brief overview of our tutorial.
