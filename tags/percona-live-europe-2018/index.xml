We also present the business needs that brought ClickHouse to our attention and detail the journey to its deployment. We cover the problems we faced, and how we dealt with them. We talk about our current Cloud production setup and how we deployed and use it.</description></item><item><title>Percona Live Europe Presents: pg_chameleon MySQL to PostgreSQL Replica Made Easy</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2018-10-26-percona-live-europe-presents-pg_chameleon-mysql-postgresql-replica-made-easy/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Oct 2018 14:42:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2018-10-26-percona-live-europe-presents-pg_chameleon-mysql-postgresql-replica-made-easy/</guid><description>What excites me is the possibility that this tool is giving to other people. Also, the challenges I’ve faced and the new ideas for the future releases are always source of interest that keep me focused on the project. So I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to sharing this with the conference delegates.
pg_chameleon can achieve two tasks in a very simple way. It can setup a permanent replica between MySQL and PostgreSQL, giving the freedom of choice for the right tool for the right job, or can migrate multiple schemas to a PostgreSQL database.</description></item><item><title>Percona Live Europe Presents: MariaDB 10.4 Reverse Privileges (DENY)</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2018-10-23-mariadb-10-4-reverse-privileges-deny/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Oct 2018 11:41:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2018-10-23-mariadb-10-4-reverse-privileges-deny/</guid><description>One of the most common questions about privileges in MySQL and MariaDB is how would a user revoke access to a particular table, in a large database with hundreds or thousands of tables, while keeping the rest available. Currently, there is no easy solution. Just grant access to everything else, individually. Not only does this reduce server performance, but is a nightmare to maintain. Reverse privileges solve this and more.</description></item><item><title>Percona Live Europe Presents: Need for speed - Boosting Apache Cassandra's performance using Netty</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2018-10-22-percona-live-europe-presents-need-speed-boosting-apache-cassandras-performance-using-netty/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Oct 2018 08:34:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2018-10-22-percona-live-europe-presents-need-speed-boosting-apache-cassandras-performance-using-netty/</guid><description>My talk is titled Need for speed: Boosting Apache Cassandra&amp;rsquo;s performance using Netty. Over the years that I have worked in the software industry, making code run fast has fascinated me. So, naturally when I first started contributing to Apache Cassandra, I started looking opportunities to improve its performance. My talk takes us through some interesting challenges within a distributed system like Apache Cassandra and various techniques to significantly improve its performance.</description></item><item><title>Percona Live Europe Presents: The Latest MySQL Replication Features</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2018-10-18-latest-mysql-replication-features/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Oct 2018 15:06:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2018-10-18-latest-mysql-replication-features/</guid><description>Considering the modern world of technology, where distributed system play a key role, replication in MySQL® is at the very heart of that change. It is very exciting to deliver this presentation and to be able to show everyone the greatest and the latest features that MySQL brings in order to continue the success that it has always been in the past.
The talk is suitable for anyone that&amp;rsquo;s interested in knowing what Oracle is doing with MySQL replication.</description></item><item><title>Percona Live Europe Presents: MariaDB System-Versioned Tables</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2018-10-17-percona-live-europe-presents-mariadb-system-versioned-tables/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Oct 2018 16:14:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2018-10-17-percona-live-europe-presents-mariadb-system-versioned-tables/</guid><description>System-versioned tables, or temporal tables, are a typical feature of proprietary database management systems like DB2, Oracle and SQL Server. They also appeared at some point in PostgreSQL, but only as an extension; and also in CockroachDB, but in a somewhat limited fashion.
The MariaDB® implementation is the first appearance of temporal tables in the MySQL ecosystem, and the most complete implementation in the open source world.</description></item><item><title>Percona Live Europe Session: What's New in MariaDB Server 10.3</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2018-10-16-percona-live-europe-session-whats-new-mariadb-server-10-3/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Oct 2018 12:42:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2018-10-16-percona-live-europe-session-whats-new-mariadb-server-10-3/</guid><description>** Having spent my recent years &amp;ldquo;in the real world&amp;rdquo;, working with many users, I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt that a particular new feature does not necessarily excite users as much as one might expect. MariaDB 10.3 however actually has some very interesting features that users do get excited about.
So that&amp;rsquo;s great!
My session at Percona Live Europe in Frankfurt is going to be best for people deploying MariaDB or related infra, who haven&amp;rsquo;t had a chance to explore what the various features actually mean, or what they can do with them.</description></item><item><title>Percona Live Europe Tutorial: Query Optimization and TLS at Large Scale</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2018-10-15-percona-live-europe-tutorial-query-optimization-workshop-tls-large-scale-session/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Oct 2018 14:05:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2018-10-15-percona-live-europe-tutorial-query-optimization-workshop-tls-large-scale-session/</guid><description>For Percona Live Europe this year, I got accepted a workshop on query optimization and a 50-minute talk covering TLS for MySQL at Large Scale, talking about our experiences at the Wikimedia Foundation.
Workshop The 3-hour workshop on Monday, titled Query Optimization with MySQL 8.0 and MariaDB 10.3: The Basics is a beginners' tutorial–though dense in content. It&amp;rsquo;s for people who are more familiar with database storage systems other than InnoDB for MySQL, MariaDB or Percona Server.</description></item><item><title>Percona Live Europe Tutorial: Elasticsearch 101</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2018-10-03-percona-live-tutorial-elasticsearch-101/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Oct 2018 07:17:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2018-10-03-percona-live-tutorial-elasticsearch-101/</guid><description>For Percona Live Europe, I&amp;rsquo;ll be presenting the tutorial Elasticsearch 101 alongside my colleagues and fellow presenters from ObjectRocket Alex Cercel, DBA, and Mihai Aldoiu, Data Engineer. Here&amp;rsquo;s a brief overview of our tutorial.
Elasticsearch® is well known as a highly scalable search engine that stores data in a structure optimized for language based searches but its capabilities and use cases don’t stop there. In this tutorial, we’ll give you a hands-on introduction to Elasticsearch and give you a glimpse at some of the fundamental concepts.</description></item></channel></rss>
